## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well

- Theme switching system is fully functional
- Content collections properly configured
- Build process is fast and reliable
- RSS feed generation working
- Mobile responsive design in place
- Reading time calculation working

### üöß Areas Needing Attention

- No linting configuration (code quality could be improved)
- Missing error pages (users see default browser errors)
- No automated testing (quality assurance gaps)
- Bundle size not optimized (could be smaller)
- Limited TypeScript strictness (potential runtime errors)

### üéØ Success Metrics

- Lighthouse scores: Aim for 95+ in all categories
- Build time: Keep under 30 seconds
- Bundle size: Main JS bundle under 50KB
- Core Web Vitals: All green scores
- Test coverage: 80%+ for critical components

### üìã Development Workflow

1. Prioritize high-priority items first
2. Set up proper development tooling early
3. Add testing as features are implemented
4. Monitor performance throughout development
5. Regular code reviews and quality checks

## Notes

### Project Health Indicators

- ‚úÖ Dependencies are up to date
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds without errors
- ‚úÖ All content renders correctly
- ‚ùå No linting or code quality checks
- ‚ùå No automated testing
- ‚ùå No proper error handling

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Start with ESLint/Prettier setup for immediate code quality improvement
