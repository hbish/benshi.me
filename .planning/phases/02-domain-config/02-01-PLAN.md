**Tech stack available:**

- wrangler@4.58.0 CLI (authenticated to Cloudflare)
- Cloudflare Pages project "benshi-me" created
- Project URL: https://benshi-me.pages.dev/

**Established patterns:**

- Cloudflare operations via wrangler CLI (pnpm wrangler)
- Project naming: hyphenated format for Cloudflare compatibility

**Constraining decisions (from Phase 1):**

- Project name: "benshi-me" (hyphenated for Cloudflare compatibility)
- Production branch: main (matches current git branch)
- Using wrangler CLI for programmatic Cloudflare management

**Key context:**

- wrangler CLI does NOT support custom domain management (must use dashboard or API)
- Domain benshi.me must be a Cloudflare zone for apex domain support
- Cloudflare will auto-create CNAME record after domain is added </context>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Add benshi.me custom domain via Cloudflare dashboard</action>
  <instructions>
    I checked and wrangler CLI does NOT support custom domain management - dashboard is required.

    Follow these steps in the Cloudflare dashboard:
    1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
    2. Navigate to Workers & Pages
    3. Select the "benshi-me" project
    4. Go to Custom domains tab
    5. Click "Set up a domain"
    6. Enter "benshi.me" as the domain
    7. Click Continue

    Since benshi.me is an apex domain, Cloudflare will:
    - Verify the domain is a Cloudflare zone (should already be)
    - Automatically create a CNAME record for the Pages project

  </instructions>
  <verification>After completing, I will verify via wrangler that the project shows the custom domain</verification>
  <resume-signal>Type "done" when the custom domain has been added in the dashboard</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify custom domain is added</name>
  <files>None (verification only)</files>
  <action>Use wrangler to list the Pages project and confirm the custom domain appears in the output. Run: pnpm wrangler pages project list --filter-name=benshi-me. The production URL should now include benshi.me.</action>
  <verify>wrangler output shows the project with custom domain configured</verify>
  <done>Custom domain benshi.me appears in project configuration</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Custom domain added via Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] wrangler shows project with custom domain
- [ ] Custom domains tab in dashboard shows benshi.me
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Custom domain benshi.me added to Cloudflare Pages project
- Dashboard shows domain in Custom domains tab
- Ready for DNS verification in next plan </success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-domain-config/02-01-SUMMARY.md`:

# Phase 2 Plan 1: Add Custom Domain Summary

**Custom domain benshi.me added to Cloudflare Pages project via dashboard.**

## Accomplishments

- Added benshi.me custom domain via Cloudflare dashboard (wrangler CLI limitation)
- Verified domain appears in project configuration

## Files Created/Modified

- None (dashboard operation only)

## Decisions Made

- Used dashboard instead of wrangler CLI (CLI does not support custom domain management)
- Confirmed benshi.me is a Cloudflare zone (required for apex domain)

## Issues Encountered

- wrangler CLI does not support custom domain management - documented as expected behavior

## Next Step

Ready for 02-02-PLAN.md - Configure DNS settings and verify SSL certificate </output>
