**Current state:** Album index uses `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` (2 columns on larger screens)
**Desired state:** Single column layout at all viewport sizes

**Issues being addressed:** UAT request for single-column album index </context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Change album index to single column layout</name>
  <files>src/pages/photos.astro</files>
  <action>Modify the album index page to use single column layout:

1. Change the grid classes from `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` to just `grid-cols-1`
2. This will make albums display in a single vertical column at all viewport sizes
3. Keep the existing max-width wrapper (`max-w-[85%] md:max-w-[90%] lg:max-w-none mx-auto`)
4. Keep skeleton loading states on album covers
5. Keep album titles as links to album detail pages

The change is simple - remove the `sm:grid-cols-2` breakpoint so only `grid-cols-1` remains.
</action> <verify>Album index page shows albums in single column; grid is 1 column at all viewport
sizes</verify> <done>Album index page displays albums in single vertical column</done> </task>

- [ ] Album index shows single column layout
- [ ] Layout is 1 column at all viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Album index page: single column layout at all viewport sizes
- Max-width wrapper still applied for centered appearance
