**Current state:** Both pages use `max-w-[85%] md:max-w-[90%] lg:max-w-none mx-auto` **Desired
state:** 60% width container using `max-w-[60%] mx-auto`

**Issues being addressed:** User requested 60% width for both album pages </context>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Change both album pages to 60% width container</name>
  <files>src/pages/photos.astro, src/pages/photos/[slug].astro</files>
  <action>Modify both album index and album detail pages to use 60% max-width:

1. In `src/pages/photos.astro` (album index):
   - Find the max-width wrapper div
   - Change from `max-w-[85%] md:max-w-[90%] lg:max-w-none mx-auto`
   - To: `max-w-[60%] mx-auto`

2. In `src/pages/photos/[slug].astro` (album detail):
   - Find the max-width wrapper div around the photo grid section
   - Change from `max-w-[85%] md:max-w-[90%] lg:max-w-none mx-auto`
   - To: `max-w-[60%] mx-auto`

3. Keep the `mx-auto` for centering
4. Keep all other styling (skeleton loading, grid layouts, etc.)

This is a simple width constraint change - the 60% width will make both pages more focused and
visually consistent. </action> <verify>Both album index and album detail pages show content
