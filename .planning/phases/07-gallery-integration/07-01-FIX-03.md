<context>
@src/pages/photos.astro
@src/pages/photos/[slug].astro

**Current state:**

- Album index: single column (`grid-cols-1`)
- Album detail: 2 columns (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`)
- Album detail has title section

**Desired state:**

- Album index: 2 columns (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`)
- Album detail: single column (`grid-cols-1`)
- Album detail: no title section

**Issues being addressed:** User requested layout swap and title removal </context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Swap layouts and remove album detail title</name>
  <files>src/pages/photos.astro, src/pages/photos/[slug].astro</files>
  <action>Swap column layouts between pages and remove title from album detail:

1. In `src/pages/photos.astro` (album index):
   - Change grid from `grid-cols-1` to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`
   - Keep the 60% max-width container

2. In `src/pages/photos/[slug].astro` (album detail):
   - Change grid from `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-1`
   - Remove the title section: delete the div with class "section-title" containing
     {collection.data.title}
   - Keep the description div if it exists
   - Keep the tag pills navigation
   - Keep the "Back to Albums" link at bottom
   - Keep the 60% max-width container

This swaps the visual approach: album index shows a 2-column grid of albums, individual album photos
show in a single focused column. </action> <verify>Album index is 2-column, album detail is single
column, album detail has no title</verify> <done>Layouts swapped, album detail title removed</done>
</task>
